# Asciify-video
This project aims at converting mp4 videos to ascii videos. Ascii videos means videos where each frame consists of ASCII characters instead of pixels. The video is broken down into several frames. The frame_rate can be decided by the user by changing the corresponding variable. Any change in frame_rate must be accompanied with corresponding change in the fps keeping in mind the relation, frame_rate x fps = 1. Each frame is then converted to grayscale image which are then processed and converted to ASCII images one by one. The ASCII images are then merged to create the final video output.
